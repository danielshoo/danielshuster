            I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a bachelors in Computer Science and 10+ years experience. My current area of focus is frontend, mobile, and desktop application development, though I have extensive backend development & database experience. As a Lead Frontend Engineer guiding a team of three, I enjoy collaborating closely with UX and product managers to realize pixel perfect designs and bring an enjoyable user experience to high traffic pages. When there is a challenge to be met, or a problem to solve, I'm interested in taking it on utilizing best practices, leaning on industry standards, and implementing clean code & architecture. When Web Development is not involved, I'm busy being a full time cat dad, wood-working enthusiast, trail hiker, and dungeon master.
